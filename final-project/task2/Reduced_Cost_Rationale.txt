Reduced the number of EC2 Web and Application instances from 20 to 6.  I think this should be sufficient to serve the project 50,000 users.  I also choose reserved 2 instances instead of on-demand since I'd always want to have at least two instances running for failover.
Reduced IOPS from 10000 to 5000 on the master database.  The read replica still uses 10000 IOPS.  I assume the read-replica will get more traffic since social media applications have significantly more reads than writes.
